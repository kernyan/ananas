     *   Virtual                       Physical
     *   0x00000000-0x3fffffff  /  \

     *   0xc0000000-0xffffffff  \  /
     *
     * The kernel lives at 0xffffffff80100000, which conveniently matches up
     * with 1MB in physical memory (where we should have placed it).
     *
     * We use 2MB pages as any amd64-capable processor supports this.
